<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Calculator Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/A2XdScH.png)

You can string multiple operations together. Also, keyboard inputs are supported! All logic was created using Vanilla JavaScript and SCSS as the preprocessor for CSS.

For this project I focused on the logic and made sure everything functioned well without any hindering bugs. Compared to my other projects, I didn't spend much of my time making it look perfect. There were tons of bugs I had to fix and I tried my best to solve it myself and not search for an answer right away so I did have to spend most of my time using chrome's debugger tool to debug and it was incredibly helpful.

### Features

- Ability to calculate multiple strings of operations
- Add, subtract, multiply and divide values
- Remove a value or clear the calculator
- Keyboard support

### Built With

- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
